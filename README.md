# ffmpeg-cuda
Just incase i delete this lmao,
This script utilizes FFmpeg with CUDA support to transform image frames into a video. 
It prompts users for a folder containing frames, constructs an FFmpeg command with specified settings, and executes it.
It's designed for easy customization of settings and to reduce the time needed to encode videos with the regular VideoExport Plugin
